Node - A Maths and Programming Club :smirk_cat:
{{</lead >}}

## What is Node?

Node was founded to cultivate an interest for maths and programming in students. Unfortunately the standard school curriculum has utterly failed in this regard but countless groups, organizations and communities are working towards fixing this and Node hopes to contribute to this effort. But Node differs from these organisations as it is a club. Various club activities ranging from classes, events and competitions are our preferred weapon to tackle the above challenege. Also, we are not affiliated to any particular school so most everyone is welcome!

## A little bit about the staff

Every (great) club has (great) staff. I'll probably need to make this section anyways because we're also doing this as an ECA so here we go.

### Navid Tawsif, President
