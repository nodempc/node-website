## Introduction

Hello and welcome to **Intro to Programming**. As is hinted in the title, I've decided to start with Python. This was totally not an arbitrary decision and great thought has been put into it. In any case, Python has its perks. It's easy to get started with, you can quickly start building cool stuff, and it's a great general purpose language which might come in handy for lots of projects. 

## Before getting started...

You need some basic stuff. There is no prerequisite knowledge for this except for maybe knowing English and Bangla. You also need access to a PC or laptop. If you want to torture yourself, you can follow along with a phone but that is highly discouraged. And last but not least you need ample amounts of time to waste.

## Installing Python on Windows

I can't be bothered to write this up. Just make sure not to download something stupid and don't mess up environment variables.

## Installing Python on Linux

It's already installed.

## Making a Hello, world! thing

After installing, look for `IDLE` in whatever OS you are using. You should find it if you installed everything correctly. So open up IDLE and type this golden phrase into the console:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
