Node is a club first and foremost for humans. Any human who is anything from slightly interested to passionate to “bored and looking for something different” can join Node as long as they don’t look completely out of place in a high school club. Node will be a fun and easy way to explore the wild world of mathematics and programming that is simply outside the scope of the school curriculum, all while befriending smart and interesting people.
